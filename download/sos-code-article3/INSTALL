               Compilation/Installation/Test instructions


Compilation
===========

IMPORTANT
---------

Don't forget to run 'make clean' before 'make' after you have modified
any source or header file(s).


On a x86 host where grub is correctly installed
-----------------------------------------------

Simply run 'make'


On a non-x86 host (without grub of course !)
--------------------------------------------

See extra/README


On an x86 host without Grub, or with a buggy Grub
-------------------------------------------------

See extra/README

How do I know I have a buggy grub installation ? Answer: in the qemu
PC emulator, Grub hangs while loading the kernel


Installation
============

Nothing special to do besides compiling


Test the SOS Kernel
===================

On a x86 real machine with Grub installed
-----------------------------------------

 1st method
   => Boot the sos.elf file (append 'kernel=<path_to>sos.elf' in the
      menu.lst or type it on Grub's command line) from a hard disk, a
      floppy, or from the network

 2nd method
   => Copy the file 'fd.img' to a floppy and boot from it


On a x86 real machine without Grub installed
--------------------------------------------

 1st method
   => see extra/README to compile with the grub floppy image we provide,
      copy the file 'fd.img' to a floppy, and boot from it

 2nd method
   => see extra/README to compile with the boot sector we provide (up to
      article 2 only), copy the file 'extra/sos_bsect.img' to a floppy,
      and boot from it


Inside a PC emulator (x86 and non-x86 hosts)
--------------------------------------------

Tested on both the bochs emulator (x86/linux, sparc/solaris and
ppc/linux hosts, 'apt-get install bochs-x vgabios' on debian
testing/unstable), and the qemu system emulator (with libsdl
installed: 'apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev' on debian
testing/unstable).

 1/ Grub is installed on the host (x86 hosts only)
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   bochs: boot from the file 'fd.img'. Example of a ~/.bochsrc:
     floppya:     1_44=/home/d2/sos/fd.img, status=inserted
     romimage:    file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xf0000
     vgaromimage: /usr/share/vgabios/vgabios.bin
     megs:63 # 63 Mo de RAM

   qemu: run 'qemu -fda fd.img'
     If grub hangs while loading the kernel, please go to method 2/

 2/ Grub is not installed (all hosts)
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  See extra/README to generate a floppy image with the Grub floppy
  image we provide, and:

   bochs: boot from the file 'fd.img'

   qemu: run 'qemu -fda fd.img'

 3/ Bonus: boot with the bootsector we provide (all hosts, up to art. 2 ONLY !)
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  
  See extra/README to generate a floppy image with the boot sector we
  provide, and:

   bochs: boot from the file 'extra/sos_bsect.img'

   qemu: run 'qemu -fda extra/sos_qemu.img'

  NOTE: After article 2, this way of booting is not supported: please
  use the method 2/ above.
